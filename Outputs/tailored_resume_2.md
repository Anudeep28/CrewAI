## Work Experience
### Crisil ltd (Lead Analyst - LA) Jan 2018 - Present
#### Jul 2023 - Present Large Language Model Assessment Framework ( LA )
- Together with the team, We utilized the insights gained from Deeplearning.ai and Coursera courses to construct an initial LLM (Legal Lifecycle Management) assessment framework.
- This framework was designed to evaluate the Inputs/outputs of the LLM model, which
we hope to mark a significant step in the application of deep learning principles to legal
assessments.
- Our collaborative effort is laying the groundwork for further advancements in the integration of AI in legal processes.
#### Jul 2021 - Dec 23 Mortgage Monitoring Model Framework in AWS Spark ( SQA / LA )
- Developed and implemented PD, EAD, and DOD frameworks in PySpark to generate a
summary info file with populated monitoring metrics.
- Conducted thorough data validation based on the model requirements provided by the
data preparation team and verified the output of the PySpark function.
- Communicated regularly with stakeholders and data owners to understand the model
specification document.
#### Jul 2020 - Jun 2021 Pricing Model Validation with Testing Automation in Python ( QA )
-Developed an automated validation tool and incorporated calibration functionality and
model parameter testing in the tool which generates scenario plots respectively and
auto-generates a consolidated Word document with all the plots.
- Understood the pricing model validation process of the client in Excel and the available
client pricing Python functions.
#### Jan 2020 - Apr 2020 Index Model Validation and testing ( QA )
- Understanding the methodology document of Index models and verification of the calculations. Verified calculations and ensured compliance with regulatory guidelines IOSCO benchmark regulations
