# By using output_json, you can specify the structure of the output you want.
# By using output_file, you can get your output in a file.

# When it asks for feedback, use your mouse pointer to first click in the text box before typing anything.

# Display the generated marketing_report.md file.
# Note: After kickoff execution has successfully ran, wait an extra 45 seconds for the marketing_report.md file to be generated. If you try to run the code below before the file has been generated, your output would look like:

# marketing_report.md
# If you see this output, wait some more and than try again.
